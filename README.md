# Advent of Code 2018

My solutions to the puzzles in [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018).

## Quick start

Make sure you have [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/) installed.

Clone this repository then build the project with:

```
stack build
```

Run the solution to a day's puzzle with:

```
cat data/day01.txt | stack run -- adventofcode 01
```

(Replace `01` above with anything from `01` to `25`.)

Run tests with:

```
stack test
```
