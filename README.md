# Advent of Code 2018

My solutions to the puzzles in [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018), in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/).

## Quick start

Make sure you have [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/) installed.

Clone this repository then build the project with:

```
stack build
```

Run the solution to a day's puzzle with:

```
cat data/day01.txt | stack run -- adventofcode 01 p1
```

Replace `01` above with any day (from `01` to `25`), and `p1` with any part (`p1` or `p2`).

Run tests with:

```
stack test
```
